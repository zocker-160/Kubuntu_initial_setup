# Kubuntu Initial Setup

Initial setup script for Kubuntu meant to be run right after a fresh installation.

This script will probably also work just fine on "normal" Ubuntu, but I have not tested it.

## Note

For the apt versions of Firefox and Chromium I am using the repository from Tuxedocomputers for Ubuntu 22.04.

So please do not freak out if their homepage is set as bookmark and default start page, I have no influence on that.
